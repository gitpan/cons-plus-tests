Cons 2.0 ($Id: RELEASE,v 1.13 2000/05/25 16:23:07 rv Exp $)
********************************************************

This is a stable release of Cons. The development release was
named 1.8b2, but the stable release has taken a new version
number, 2.0 (see below).

The major achievements in this release are so many that it doesn't
make much sense in duplicating the information already available
in the CHANGES file. Please see CHANGES for details.

I would generally like to thank all the contributors to this release
specifically like to thank Steven Knight for all the effort that
he has put in to making this release possible.

I would also like to thank the Marconi Communications (formerly FORE Systems)
management for having released `cons' under the GNU General Public License
(GPL). The version number change was to mark the new beginning of `cons'
as a GPL'd program.
