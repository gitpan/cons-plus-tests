Cons regression tests to-do list

Things that it would be good to have fixed, some day:

    --	A way to make sure that .consign files don't get clobbered
	on write errors (such as a full file system).  The code to guard
	against this has been recently added to Cons, but I can't think
	of how to simulate it in a test script without actually filling
	up the $TMPDIR file system, which is pretty anti-social on
	multi-user systems.

    --	Untested methods (placeholder scripts need writing for real):

		t/t0052.t	SourcePath
		t/t0053.t	ConsPath
		t/t0054.t	SplitPath
