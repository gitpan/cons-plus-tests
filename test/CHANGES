Cons regression test suite changes

$Id: CHANGES,v 1.5 2000/06/26 16:56:57 knight Exp $



Changes in cons release 2.1.1:

	Made the cons-test.pl script itself work under Windows NT
	(mainly avoiding fork() to spawn the tests).

	Change flags in the WIN32 CCCOM environment variable from - to /
	for Windows NT consistency.

	Exported a new $_is_win32 variable from the Test::Cmd::Cons
	module so system-dependent tests don't have to roll their own
	check.  Updated the following tests to use it:
		t/t0054.t		SplitPath
		t/t0064.t		Install failure

	Added new test (currently disabled) for future use:
		t/t0072.t		-Mstrict

	Added new tests:
		t/t0073.t		signature calculation
		t/t0074.t		case-insensitivity

	Modified existing tests for bug fixes:
		t/t0027.t		Depends
		t/t0054.t		SplitPath
		t/t0057.t		%[ %] substitution
		t/t0058.t		-t

	Modified existing tests for new features:
		t/t0034.t		-d
		t/t0139.t		-d, -R



Changes in cons release 2.0.1:

	Wrote a real test for the following placeholder:
		t/t0054.t		SplitPath



Changes in cons release 2.0:

	Integrated the formerly-separate cons-test suite into the cons
	package itself.

	Added FSF copyright and GPL notices to all relevant files.



Changes in cons-test release 3.1 (never released separately):

	Added new tests for previously untested features:
		t/t0061.t		Objects
		t/t0071.t		QuickScan

	Added new tests for bug fixes:
		t/t0064.t		Install failure
		t/t0065.t		CPPPATH with same-named file/program
		t/t0066.t		source file => unreadable derived file
		t/t0068.t		"0" as file and directory name
		t/t0069.t		CPPPATH array reference %-expansion

	Added new tests for new Cons 2.0 features:
		t/t0055.t		@ suppression
		t/t0056.t		../.. above top-level directory
		t/t0057.t		%[ %] substitution
		t/t0058.t		-t
		t/t0059.t		-t, Default sub-target
		t/t0060.t		-t, Default super-directory
		t/t0062.t		Precious
		t/t0063.t		Precious, build failure
		t/t0067.t		-t, Link
		t/t0070.t		file/directory failures

	Modified existing tests for Cons 2.0 features and fixes:
		t/t0021.t		Default
		t/t0050.t		FilePath
		t/t0036.t		%-variables
		t/t0132.t		Default, -R



Changes in cons-test release 3.0:

	Rewrote all tests in Perl.  Added the external Test::Cmd module
	for underlying management of temporary directories, program
	execution, etc.  Added our own Test::Cmd::Cons modules for
	control of Cons-specific things.

	The Perl tests don't require execute permission on the Cons
	script under test; update cons-test.pl so it no longer enforces
	that restriction.

	Added a version of Cons directly to this package to accomodate
	any necessary differences between what's currently released and
	what we're writing the tests to.  Include the released version
	of Cons we used as a basis as well, and generate diff output to
	let everyone know what's going on.

	Added two new tests:
		t/t0050.t		FilePath
		t/t0051.t		DirPath



Changes in cons-test release 2.2:

	Added tests for salting signatures and derived-file caching:
		t0038a.sh		Salt
		t0039a.sh		UseCache
		t0040a.sh		UseCache, selective update
		t0041a.sh		UseCache, -cc
		t0042a.sh		UseCache, -cd
		t0043a.sh		UseCache, -cr
		t0044a.sh		UseCache, -cs

	Added tests for handling build errors:
		t0045a.sh		error exit status
		t0046a.sh		rebuild after Program error
		t0047a.sh		rebuild after single-command Command error
		t0048a.sh		rebuild after multi-command Command error

	Added tests for InstallAs:
		t0049a.sh		InstallAs
		t0147a.sh		InstallAs, -R

	Modified all tests to get rid of non-portable ${VAR:-xxx}
	constructs and non-portable use of "test -a".

	Changed the name of Tests.doc to Tests.txt to avoid confusion
	with Microsoft Word documents.

	Added ToDo file to document additional tests that are needed
	and other future work.

	Updated the date in the README file and add a paragraph to the
	introduction.



Changes prior to cons-test release 2.1:

	Modified cons-test.pl to accept environment variable changes
	("CC=gcc") as arguments on the command line and pass them
	through to the underlying tests.

	Modified all tests to use and expand $CC, $AR, and $RANLIB
	from the environment when setting up the Cons environments
	and comparing output.
	[Fix courtesy Rajesh Vaidheeswarran.]

	Made all tests consistent in handling output from Cons:
	stdout and stderr are combined and displayed on error if
	the (sub-)test is not actually examining output.  If it
	is, then stdout and stderr are separated, stderr is displayed
	on error, and contents of both are checked on success.

	Added test of Cons -h and Help functionality:
		t0037a.sh		-h, Help
	[New functionality in cons-1.4a3 courtesy Rajesh Vaidheeswarran.]

	Added tests of new Repository-related methods:
		t0144a.sh		Repository_List
		t0145a.sh		Install + Local
		t0146a.sh		Install_Local
	(The Install + Local test was the old Local method test.)

	Changed the old test of the Local method:
		t0142a.sh		Local
	to test the Local method when used on a generated executable
	without the Install method being involved.

	Added explanation of the flags to the usage message.

	Modified cons-test.pl to issue warnings if the environment
	variables CC, AR, and RANLIB are not set, and a -q flag
	to suppress the warnings.
	[Change courtesy Rajesh Vaidheeswarran.]

	Modified tests to use the more portable test -s instead of
	test -e.
	[Bug report courtesy Rajesh Vaidheeswarran.]

Changes prior to cons-test release 2.0:

		t0141a.sh	-R, strip current directory
		t0142a.sh	Local
		t0143a.sh	Repository_Sig_Times_OK

	Added a -d dir option to the cons-test.pl script, to allow
	specification of an alternate directory in which it will
	search for tests (files with names of form t[0-9]*a.sh).

	Fixed tests t0028a.sh, t0029a.sh, and t0030a.sh to not
	hard-code the name 'cons' in the comparison output, allowing
	successful testing of scripts with other names.

Changes prior to cons-test release 1.2:

	Add a test case to cover all manner of %-variable command
	substitution.  [Bug reported by Bob Sidebotham, 22 October
	1998.]

	Fixed problems printing numbers of tests passed (unitialized
	$pass) and failed (@array needed to be in explicit scalar
	context).  [Bug reported and fix supplied by Bob Sidebotham,
	21 October 1998.]

	Added checks for existence and executability of the cons
	script under test before trying to execute the tests.
	[Bug reported by Bob Sidebotham, 21 October 1998.]

	Changed the exit subroutines to chmod the directories under
	$work even when preserving the work directories.  This
	makes it easier to clean up by hand even when the test
	removes write permission.

Changes prior to cons-test release 1.1:

	Added tests for command-line arguments:
		t0028a.sh	-f dir/Construct
		t0029a.sh	-r
		t0030a.sh	-k
		t0031a.sh	-p
		t0032a.sh	-pa
		t0033a.sh	-pw
		t0034a.sh	-d
		t0035a.sh	-wf

	Don't use system() to execute the tests, fork and exec so
	we can catch interrupts and terminate.

	Fixed the fail() routine so that it reports the sub-test
	number even if there's no input to display.

	Added a description of each test to the header of each test
	file.

	Created a 'Tests.doc' file to collect all the test descriptions
	in a central location.

	Added tests for basic functionality:
		t0001a.sh	single-module Program
		t0002a.sh	multiple-module Program

	Aegis.
