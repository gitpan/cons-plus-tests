To use cons, simply copy the `cons' program to a location where you keep
other executable binaries or scripts, like /usr/local/bin.

Win-NT users can execute the cons program in 2 ways:

       1. Rename it to cons.pl and associate the .pl suffix with perl so
	  that Windows will always execute the program inside perl.
       2. Run cons.bat.  Make sure that perl is in your
	  path when use do this.

There are a lot of ways of getting cons documentation. Listed here are a
few:

1. Users may generate various types of documentation with the cons program
itself using the pod2* utilities available with the perl distribution.

2. Another way is to use perldoc. perldoc /path/to/cons will generate a
manpage-like formatted output.

3. Alternately, users can use the man page cons.1 supplied with this
distribution and move it to a location in your manpath
(e.g. /usr/local/man/man1) and use the UNIX man command (man cons) to view
cons documentation.

4. Or, users can use the html page cons.html supplied with this distribution
and view it through a browser.
