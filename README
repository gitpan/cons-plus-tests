Cons is a Perl-based make replacement.  It is not compatible with make,
but has a number of powerful capabilities not found in other software
construction systems, including make.

Cons is distributed in two different packages, one with a full regression
test suite (cons-plus-test-$version.tgz) and the other without
(cons-$version.tgz).  There is no difference between the copies of
cons in the two packages.  Most users should only need the base package
without the test suite.  The package with the test suite is recommended
for people who are planning to add new features to cons and want to make
sure they don't break existing functionality, or who want to verify that
cons works correctly on their platform.

You will need Perl 5.002 or better and the Perl MD5 Extension
(MD5-1.6.tar.gz or greater), available from CPAN.

This program is known to work on a variety of platforms: it's in production
use on versions of FreeBSD, Linux, SunOS, Solaris, HPUX, AIX, IRIX and NT.

Documentation is supplied in POD format (thanks to Ulrich Pfiefer).
